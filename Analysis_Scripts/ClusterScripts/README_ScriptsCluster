#README

In this directory we'll find an example of the commands we use for Cutadapt and WhippetQuant for one primate (Chimpanzee).

The scripts is located in the cluster in the path: /home/gabrod/Scripts/PrimatesCircRNAs/Chimp

For the other primates, they are located in the path: /home/gabrod/Scripts/PrimatesCircRNAs/

and the corresponding directory with the primate name has the scripts for each primate.


Also in this directory we'll find the scripts used in the cluster to use bedtools and liftover
to get the conserved circRNAs from all primates
